Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Pricing

In this project, we try to implement and evaluate deep reinforcement
learning algorithms to dynamic pricing problems in business. Objective is
to maximize revenue by optimally deciding prices over time for a single
product or multiple products.

We are interested in testing and comparing single pricing approach,
standard dynamic pricing approach, and various deep reinforcement learning
aprpoaches by simulation and if possible, using real-world data set.
